	<h1>History & design</h1><hr>
	<p>In 2007, a number of spy photos and speculative design drawings were reported in the motorcycle press, with one magazine capturing a road test of the completed Street Triple. Later articles reported on leaked design shots of the new bike. A report on the showcasing of the finished bike to dealers was published on 6 March 2007, along with a spy video of a test ride.Triumph revised the Street Triple in 2017.[further explanation needed] For 2020, the more track-oriented RS version was given minor changes to the intake and exhaust with no change in power output, and cosmetic changes to the mirrors and headlight. A 1.8 in (46 mm) lower seat height version, with a different seat and modified suspension, was added.</p>
	

<h1>Used in racing</h1><hr>
<p>Since 2019 the Moto2 class in the MotoGP world championship has been powered by the 765 cc engines from the Street Triple, replacing the engines that were previously based on the Honda CBR600RR from 2010 to 2018.</p>
