	<h1>History & design</h1><hr>
	<p>The bike is named after Thruxton Circuit, a race track in Hampshire where in 1969 Triumph won the top three places in the Thruxton 500 mile endurance race. These races helped establish the "café racer" era, when standard production motorcycles were modified to improve street and racing performance.
	</p>
	<h1>Styling</h1><hr>
	<p>When the Hinckley factory began making modern triples such as the Trident and Daytona 675, even though the inspiration was perhaps the Meriden Trident, no attempt was made to link the new bikes with their Meriden forebears.

By contrast, when the Hinckley factory started to design new parallel twins, it was deemed vital to make the new bikes adopt similar "retro" styling to their Meriden predecessors. For instance, the new twins have a "timing chest" on the right, a "primary chaincase" is on the left , twin "rocker boxes", a R/H side panel resembling a dry-sump oil tank, and throttle bodies which resemble carburettors, even though the engines are fuel-injected. Triumph's desire for "retro authenticity" prescribed a tubular cradle frame, a decision which caused the bikes to be heavier than they otherwise might have been.</p>

<h1>Triumph Thruxton Cup Challenge</h1><hr>
<p>In 2005, Triumph Motorcycles (America) Ltd. and the American Historic Racing Motorcycle Association (AHRMA) developed the Triumph Thruxton Cup Challenge at Pueblo Motorsports Park in Colorado as a “spec” class race limited to the Triumph Thruxton 900. Ted “Cannonball” Cobb, won the inaugural cup.</p>
