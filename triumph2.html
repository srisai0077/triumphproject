		<h1>Triumph Motorcycles Ltd</h1><hr>
		<ul>
			<li>Triumph Cycle (1884–1930) original Triumph, founded by Siegfried Bettmann</li>
			<li>Triumph (TWN) (1896–1956) German manufacturer also founded by Bettmann</li>
			<li>Triumph Motor Company (1930–1936) precursor to Triumph Engineering (1936–1983)</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>Triumph Motorcycles Ltd is the largest UK-owned motorcycle manufacturer, established in 1983 by John Bloor after the original company Triumph Engineering went into receivership. The new company, initially called Bonneville Coventry Ltd, continued Triumph's lineage of motorcycle production since 1902. They have major manufacturing facilities in Thailand.During the 12 months preceding June 2017, Triumph sold 63,400 motorcycles.<br><br></p>
		<h1>History</h1><hr>
		<p>When Triumph Engineering went into receivership in 1983, John Bloor bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver. The new company's manufacturing plant were outdated and unable to compete against the technology from Japanese manufacturers, so Bloor decided against relaunching Triumph immediately. Initially, production of the old Bonneville was continued under licence by Les Harris of Racing Spares, in Newton Abbot, Devon, to bridge the gap between the end of the old company and the start of the new company. For five years from 1983, about 14 a week were built at peak production. In the United States, owing to problems with liability insurance, the Harris Bonnevilles were never imported.</p><br>
		<h1>Model range</h1><hr>
		<p>A range of new 750 cc and 900 cc triple-cylinder bikes and 1000 cc and 1200 cc four-cylinder bikes were launched at the September 1990 Cologne Motorcycle Show. The motorcycles used famous model names from the glory days of Meriden Triumph and were first made available to the public between March (Trophy 1200 being the first) and September 1991. All used a modular liquid-cooled DOHC engine design in a common large diameter steel backbone frame. The modular design was to ensure that a variety of models could be offered whilst keeping production costs under control—an idea originally put forward, in air-cooled form, in the early 1970s by Bert Hopwood but not implemented by the then BSA-Triumph company.</p><br>
		<h1>Triumph Factory Custom motorcycles</h1><hr>
		<p>In December 2018, Triumph said they were developing a new range of high spec limited edition motorcycles, called Triumph Factory Custom (TFC). The first model was the Thruxton TFC, with production run limited to 750 units. In May 2019, the second model, the Rocket 3 TFC, was introduced at a motorbike show at Shoreditch, London. In November 2019, Triumph announced a third TFC model, the Bobber TFC, at the EICMA Motorcycle Show in Milan.</p><br>
		<h1>Racing</h1><hr>
		<p>From 2019 season onwards for a three-year contract, Triumph are the controlled-engine supplier for the FIM Moto2 World Championship. All Moto2 teams changed from a Honda CBR600 unit to a 765cc triple-cylinder engine supplied by Triumph that was originally developed from the Street Triple RS engine, but with additional race tuning that creates at least 138PS peak power. Engines are prepared by ExternPro, an independent business based in Spain.</p><br>
		<h1>Marketing, product placement, and brand management</h1><hr>
		<p>In 1995, Triumph began selling the Triple Connection clothing and accessories range of products, designed by Triumph rather than licensed. In the 21st century, Triumph marketed lines of clothing with endorsements or likenesses of celebrities associated with the brand in the past, including Bob Dylan, and the deceased Marlon Brando, Elvis Presley, James Dean, and Steve McQueen. McQueen's name and likeness were particularly put to use, such as naming a special edition Bonneville after him.</p>
