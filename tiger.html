	<h1>Triumph Tiger</h1><hr>
	<p>The Triumph Tiger  (marketed as Triumph Tiger 1200 since November 2017) is a dual-sport motorcycle that was announced by British company Triumph Motorcycles at the EICMA show in November 2011. There are currently 2 models available; Tiger Explorer XR Family and Tiger Explorer XC Family. Both models have similar specifications, but the XC comes with a set-up that is more adept with off road riding like spoked wheels instead of aluminium cast ones. They are both powered by a 1,215 cc (74.1 cu in) straight-three engine with four valves per cylinder and a six-speed gearbox with shaft final drive. Triumph claim that the engine produces power of 135 hp (101 kW) and torque of 89 lb⋅ft (121 N⋅m). Switchable ABS, cruise control, and traction control are standard.</p>

Both bikes share the same frame and 799 cubic centimetres (48.8 cu in) inline-three engine, which is derived from the smaller Triumph Daytona 675. In both cases an official Triumph accessory low seat lowers seat heights by 20 mm. The 2011 model year featured a silver frame, but from 2012-2018 the Tiger had a black frame with the exception of SE (Special Edition) models that had a red frame and accessories.All version have switchable ABS, twin 305 mm front brake discs and single 255 mm disc, LCD screens with digital instruments.

	<h1>Model differences</h1><hr>
	<p>There are a number of key differences between the two models. The XR has cast alloy wheels, with a 19-inch at the front, while the XC has spoked wheels with alloy rims and a larger 21-inch front. They have the same size of 17" at the rear.

The Tiger 800 XC has longer-travel suspension at the front and rear, with 45 mm forks, compared with 43 mm on the Tiger 800 XR. The Tiger 800 XR has a motorcycle saddle adjustable from 810 to 830 millimetres (32 to 33 in), while the Tiger 800 XC saddle is taller at 845 to 865 millimetres (33.3 to 34.1 in). The XC has more aggressive off-road looks, including a small beak-like high-level mudguard at the front, similar to the BMW F800GS, a bike the Tiger is designed to compete against. Overall the XC is longer, wider, taller and heavier than the XR. The Tiger 800 XC was named "Best Dual Sport" for 2011 by Cycle World.

Both models share most components, including the engine, 19-litre (4.2 imp gal; 5.0 US gal) fuel tank, instrument panel, steel trellis frame, and brakes, which have optional ABS.</p>
